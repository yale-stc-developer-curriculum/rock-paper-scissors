<b><i>Styslinger and Esterman Still Pretty Freakin' Awesome</i></b>

Paul received his Ph.D in geological sciences at the age of 8. Phil has studied origami under Buddhist monk Hsu-Wong since the early 70's.

A genius of rocks. A humble worshipper of paper. And a common love for cutting random crap to shreds.

Rock, Paper, Scissors- Gametime, bitches. 
<p> Paul and Phil have dominated the RPS arena for years. The two devilishly good-looking dudes have nabbed fourteen national championships in the last four years. </p>
