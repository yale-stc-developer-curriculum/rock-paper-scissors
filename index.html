<p><b>Matt</b> became the youngest ever Rock Paper Scissors Champion of Long Island at the age of three. Soon after he began intensive Rock-Paper-Scissors training developing mental toughness, lightning fast reflexes and the ability to read minds by studying and training ligers in Translyvania. He now owns 23 ligers and has traveled with all of them to every continent of the world to demonstrate his Rock-Paper-Scissor dominance. The ligers respond only to his command. You were warned.</p>
<p>Hailing from the Great Icy North of Minnesota, <b>Sonja</b> has undergone great struggle to travel to New Haven for this tournament to end all tournaments. She rode here on a tall mocha-colored stallion named Wednesday, on which she rode out on and on which she arrived here. Her hands are fierce and ready for action. Her rocks are smooth and circular, her scissors are sharper than a dolphin's back left molar tooth, and her paper is devious and college ruled. She is a force to be reckoned with. Beware all.</p>
