<p><b>Matt</b> became the youngest ever Rock Paper Scissors Champion of Long Island at the age of three. Soon after he began intensive Rock-Paper-Scissors training developing mental toughness, lightning fast reflexes and the ability to read minds by studying and training ligers in Translyvania. He now owns 23 ligers and has traveled with all of them to every continent of the world to demonstrate his Rock-Paper-Scissor dominance. The ligers respond only to his command. You were warned.</p>
<p>Hailing from the Great Icy North of Minnesota, <b>Sonja</b> has undergone great struggle to travel to New Haven for this tournament to end all tournaments. She rode here on a tall mocha-colored stallion named Wednesday, on which she rode out on and on which she arrived here. Her hands are fierce and ready for action. Her rocks are smooth and circular, her scissors are sharper than a dolphin's back left molar tooth, and her paper is devious and college ruled. She is a force to be reckoned with. Beware all.</p>

<center><h3> Team Button </h3></center>
<p>Competing for almost 20 years, Team Button has proven to be one of the most prominent teams in the Rock, Paper, Scissors Competition. They rank #1 in the HTML Conference and are quickly climbing up the ranks nationally.</p>
<p>Hailing from the small town of Tewksbury, MA, <b>Dana Chaykovsky</b> is considered one of the fiercest forces on this side of the Mississippi. She sails across the ocean and fights space cowboys along with her rock, paper, scissors endeavors and is also a world-renowned connoisseur of sweets.</p>
<p>A beautiful woman from colorful Argentina, <b>Natalia Castillejo</b> has been training for rock, paper, scissors competitions since the age of eight. She trained under the most influential rock, paper, scissors champions of South America and now competes internationally in the sport. In her free time, she frequently swims across the English Channel and presents her painitings to the New York Metropolitan Museum.
