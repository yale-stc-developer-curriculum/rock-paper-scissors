<h1>Prepare to be rocked by Zarocks.css!</h1>

<h2 id="subtitle"> Once upon a time, there were three rival pairs: the Gods of Rock, the Gods of Paper, and the Gods of Scissors. The Gods of Rock were called Zarocks. The Gods of Paper were called jankenpon. And the Gods of Scissors were called Team Vivecandres. On a summer morning in New Haven, the cosmos aligned: the three most powerful Rock, Paper, Scissors teams of all time assembled to become one.</h2>
